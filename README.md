# Marquês de Itu
A simple, minimalistic, distraction-free theme for Vim. During my time living on the bohemian Marquês de Itu street in São Paulo, I used this photo by my friend @brunohenrique as my background for a long time and became obsessed with grayscale [setups](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5kbkc1/i3wm_life_isnt_colorful_my_friend/).

## Technical details

This is a 256-color theme. These days I try to use as vanilla a setup as possible, so I rely on Terminal.app, which only supports 256 colors.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/brennovich/marques-de-itu.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/marques-de-itu
```

Then set the colorscheme in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
colorscheme marques-de-itu
```
